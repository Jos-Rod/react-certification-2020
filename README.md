## Answers for 2 challenge

1. Using create-react-app, what do we need to set up for testing?
    Create the files to test, ex. if the component to test is NavBar.component.jsx
    the test file should look like NavBar.test.js
2. What components are worth to test in your development?
    All, to ensure that everything works properly every time a change is integrated.
3. Can you apply TDD once you already created components?
    No, to apply correctly TDD, the tests need to be created first, in order for the 
    component or functionality to approve the test. Changes maybe needed through
    the develpoment, but the principle is to create the tests first and then create
    the components.
